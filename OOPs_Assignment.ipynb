        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "->  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or logic.\n",
        "An object is a real-world entity that has data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior and properties of the objects created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It represents a real-world entity that has data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Both abstraction and encapsulation are key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a clear comparison 👇\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature         | **Abstraction**                                                                | **Encapsulation**                                                            |\n",
        "| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
        "| **Meaning**     | Hides *implementation details* and shows *only essential features*.            | Hides *data* by bundling it with methods that control access.                |\n",
        "| **Focus**       | Focuses on *what* an object does.                                              | Focuses on *how* data is protected.                                          |\n",
        "| **Purpose**     | To simplify complex systems by showing only necessary parts.                   | To protect data from unauthorized access or modification.                    |\n",
        "| **Achieved by** | Using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.                                  | Using **private/public/protected access modifiers** and **getters/setters**. |\n",
        "| **Example**     | You can drive a car without knowing how its engine works — that’s abstraction. | The car’s engine details are hidden inside — that’s encapsulation.           |\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) are special built-in methods that start and end with double underscores (__).\n",
        "\n",
        "They are also called magic methods because they allow you to customize how objects behave with built-in operations (like printing, addition, comparison, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        ". It helps in code reusability and represents an “is-a” relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " -> Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means \"many forms\" — it allows the same function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, the same operation can behave differently for different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -> Encapsulation in Python is the process of restricting direct access to an object’s data (variables) and methods, and controlling it through public, protected, or private access levels.\n",
        "It helps in data hiding and protecting the internal state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is instantiated.\n",
        "It allows you to set up initial values for the object’s attributes automatically when you create it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, class methods and static methods are two special types of methods used inside a class — both are not the same as normal instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s understand both clearly 👇\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. Instance Method (Default)\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Regular method that operates on a specific object (instance) of the class.\n",
        "✅ It can access and modify instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Class Method\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "✅ Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class, not an instance).\n",
        "✅ Can access or modify class-level variables but not instance variables directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method Overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters — however, Python does not support true method overloading like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 In Python, the latest defined method overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "But we can simulate overloading using default parameters or *args (variable arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method Overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a child (subclass) defines a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its parent (superclass) — but provides a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 It allows a subclass to customize or replace behavior inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Key Idea\n",
        "\n",
        ". Same method name and parameters\n",
        "\n",
        ". Defined in both parent and child classes\n",
        "\n",
        ". The child class method overrides the parent class method during runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a class method into a “getter”, allowing you to access it like an attribute — without calling it like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is mainly used to control access to instance variables (data encapsulation) while keeping a clean, attribute-like interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it makes programs more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows one interface to be used for different types of objects, making your code easier to extend and modify without breaking existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Main Reasons Why Polymorphism Is Important\n",
        "1. Code Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "You can write one function or method that works with different object types, instead of duplicating code for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def make_sound(animal):\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "make_sound(Dog())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "make_sound(Cat())  # Output: Meow\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ The same make_sound() function works for both Dog and Cat.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add new classes (e.g., Cow, Lion) without changing existing code.\n",
        "Just define a speak() method, and they’ll work automatically with make_sound().\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 You can extend the system easily — that’s open/closed principle in action (open for extension, closed for modification).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes — it defines a common structure that its subclasses must follow, but it cannot be instantiated (you can’t create an object directly from it).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is mainly used to enforce certain methods in all subclasses — ensuring they provide specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        ". Defined using the abc module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",
        "\n",
        ". You use the decorator @abstractmethod to declare abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Subclasses must override all abstract methods, otherwise they can’t be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Promotes polymorphism and code consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes — it defines a common structure that its subclasses must follow, but it cannot be instantiated (you can’t create an object directly from it).\n",

        "\n",
        ". You use the decorator @abstractmethod to declare abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        ". Promotes polymorphism and code consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The main difference between a class variable and an instance variable in Python lies in how and where the data is stored and shared among objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s break it down 👇\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. Instance Variable\n",

        "\n",
        ". Each object has its own copy of the variable.\n",

        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Class Variable\n",

        "\n",
        "-> Multiple inheritance in Python means that a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "In simple words — a child class can have multiple base classes, and it will inherit attributes and methods from all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",

        "\n",
        ". It is meant to return a human-readable, friendly description of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a child (derived) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s especially useful in inheritance, allowing the child class to reuse code from its parent class without naming the parent class explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "🧠 Purpose of super()\n",
        "\n",
        ". To access parent class methods or attributes inside a subclass.\n",

        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __del__() method in Python is a destructor — it is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it goes out of scope or its reference count becomes zero).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used to clean up resources like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting network connections before the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",

        "In OOP, polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name, but possibly with different behaviors.\n",

        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method chaining in Python OOP means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another — just like a “chain.”\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (usually self), so that the next method can be called on it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "🧩 Simple Definition:\n",
